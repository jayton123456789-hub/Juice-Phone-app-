# Scanner (CLI)

Standalone CLI for building a large Juice WRLD song metadata dataset using:
1. Juice WRLD API data (`https://juicewrldapi.com/juicewrld`)
2. No-key web context snippets (DuckDuckGo Instant Answer)
3. **Your local Ollama models** for mood/theme/deep analysis

This does **not** modify the desktop app. It is fully isolated in `Scanner/`.
